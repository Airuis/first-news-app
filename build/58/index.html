            <p>Eduardo C. Vela, a 33-year-old Latino, was shot and killed Wednesday, April 29, 1992, in the 5100 block of West Slauson Avenue in Ladera Heights. Vela, a Mexican immigrant who ran a Japanese restaurant in Bakersfield, was visiting Los Angeles on the day the riots broke out. He was killed as he waited behind the steering wheel of his disabled car while a co-worker, Estevan Ortigoza, went to make a telephone call.</p>
