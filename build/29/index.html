            <p>Thanh Lam, a 25-year-old Asian man, was shot and killed Thursday, April 30, 1992, in Compton. Lam was leaving his family&#39;s market in Compton, which had been looted and burned the night before. The traffic signal at Willowbrook Avenue and Alondra Boulevard had turned yellow, and Lam slowed to a stop. A car bumped him from the rear and pulled up in the next lane. At least two gunmen leaned out with handguns and began firing. One bullet shattered the truck&#39;s window; a volley of shots ripped into the cab. Four bullets hit Lam, and within minutes he was dead.</p>
